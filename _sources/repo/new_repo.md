# First Repo

Let's assume you are working in a private project. You first need to create
your repository on GitHub. For this:

1. If you are not already logged in, go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.
2. Click on the `+` sign in the top right corner and select `New repository`.

3. Fill in the repository name, description, and select if you want it to be public or private. Then click on `Create repository`.
Other options are available, but for now, we will keep it simple. 
>The description is optional, but it can help others understand what the repository is about.
>So, it is a good practice to add one or two sentences describing the content/objective of the repository.

>You can start with a private repository, and later, if you want to share it with others, you can change it to public.

:::{admonition} Example:
I created a repository *named* `vcca2024-share-with-github`.
The *description* is `Repository for sharing code and files with the VCCA 2024 workshop participants`.
An, I selected the repository to be *public*.

:::{note}
If you are part of a project, you might want to create a repository under the organization. In this case, you will need to select the organization in the `Owner` field.

Also, you can initialize the repository with a README file, a `.gitignore` file, and a license.
There is more information about these options in the GitHub documentation.

4. Once the repository is created, you will see the repository page. You can see the URL of the repository in the address bar of your browser.

## Making changes to your repo

After a repository has been created, you can make changes to it like 
changing the repo name, description, adding files, etc.

### Change Name

To change the name of the repository:

1. Go to the repository page.
2. Click on the `Settings` tab.
3. In the `Repository name` field, change the name of the repository.
4. Click on `Rename`.

:::{admonition} Example:
I am changing the name `vcca2024-share-with-github` to `vcca2024-share-with-github-demo`.

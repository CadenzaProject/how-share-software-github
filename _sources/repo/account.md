## Special repositories

GitHub has a few special repositories that you should be aware of:

```{admonition} Profile repository
:class: dropdown
When you create your account, GitHub automatically creates a special repository for 
your profile. The name of this repository is the same as your username. 
This repository is used to store information about you, such as your bio, 
profile picture, and repositories.

For example:
* Username `groadabike`: `https://github.com/groadabike`. 
* Username `claritychallenge`: `https://github.com/claritychallenge`.
* Username `CadenzaProject`: `https://github.com/CadenzaProject`.

To know more about this repository and how to customize it, please access the 
[about your profile](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/about-your-profile)
webpage

```

```{admonition} Personal Website repository
:class: dropdown
GitHub also provides you with a free personal website using GitHub Pages.
This is a great way to showcase your work, share your resume, or blog about your projects.
To create a personal website, you need to create a special repository named 
`<username>.github.io`, where `<username>` is your GitHub username.

For example:
* Username `groadabike`: groadabike.github.io.
* Username `claritychallenge`: claritychallenge.github.io.
* Username `CadenzaProject`: CadenzaProject.github.io.

You can also use your personal domain name.

For example:
* https://www.gerardoroadabike.com/. 
* https://claritychallenge.org/.
* https://cadenzachallenge.org/.

To know more about how to create a personal website, please access the

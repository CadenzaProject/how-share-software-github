To start working in your repository, you need to make a local copy of it.
This is called **cloning** the repository. To clone the repository:

2. CD to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CadenzaProject/vcca2024-share-with-github-demo.git

## Special repositories

GitHub has a few special repositories that you should be aware of:

### Profile repository

When you create your account, GitHub automatically creates a special repository for 
your profile. The name of the repository is the same as your username. 
This repository is used to store information about you, such as your bio, 
profile picture, and repositories.

To know more about this repository and how to customize it, please access the 
[about your profile](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/about-your-profile)
webpage

### Personal Website repository

GitHub also allows you to create a personal website using GitHub Pages.
This is a great way to showcase your work, share your resume, or blog about your projects.
To create a personal website, you need to create a special repository named 
`<username>.github.io`, where `<username>` is your GitHub username.

To know more about how to create a personal website, please access the
[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
webpage.

# First Repository

Let's assume you are working in a private project. You first need to create
your repository on GitHub. For this:

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.
2. Click on the `+` sign in the top right corner and select `New repository`.

3. Fill in the repository name, description, and select if you want it to be public or private. Then click on `Create repository`.
Other options are available, but for now, we will keep it simple.

If you are part of a project, you might want to create a repository under the organization. In this case, you will need to select the organization in the `Owner` field.

Also, you can initialize the repository with a README file, a `.gitignore` file, and a license.
There is more information about these options in the GitHub documentation.

4. Once the repository is created, you will see the repository page. You can see the URL of the repository in the address bar of your browser.

Welcome, and thank you for joining me in this workshop at [VCCA 2024](https://computationalaudiology.com/events/vcca2024/).

In this workshop, I will share with you some of the key skills for effectively

## Why Use GitHub?

GitHub is a powerful tool that can help you in many ways, including:

- **Version Control**: Keep track of changes in your code, and revert to previous versions if needed.
- **Collaboration**: Work with others on the same project, and keep track of who did what.
- **Code Review**: Get feedback on your code from others, and improve its quality.
- **Issue Tracking**: Keep track of bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to your project.
- **Continuous Integration**: Automate testing and deployment of your code, making it easier to maintain and scale.
- **Documentation**: Write and maintain documentation for your project, making it easier for others to understand and use it.
